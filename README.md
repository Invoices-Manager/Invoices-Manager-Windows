# Invoices Manager (written in WPF C#   DOTNET6.0)

## Important Info!
The program may contain errors, if any are found, please report them, 
I always recommend to make a BackUp of the Data Folder or to do it 
via the BackUp function in the program.


## Application description:
Are you also tired of putting all your invoices (and other documents) 
in one folder and then having to search for them? <br/>
Now it has an end, with this you can import and manage them. 
It's simple, there are enough ways to filter your documents.
