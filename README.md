# Invoices Manager (written in WPF C#   DOTNET6.0)

## Important Info!
The program may contain errors, if any are found, please report them, 
I always recommend to make a BackUp of the Data Folder or to do it 
via the BackUp function in the program.  
  

## Application description:
Are you also tired of putting all your invoices (and other documents) 
in one folder and then having to search for them? <br/>
Now it has an end, with this you can import and manage them,  
and the best comes now, all in a cloud that can also be hosted by you!  
([press here](https://github.com/Invoices-Manager/Invoices-Manager-API#readme) to see more about the API) 
It's simple, there are enough options to filter your documents.
